# 🎯 Object Recognition and Tracking System

A Python-based application that performs real-time object recognition and tracking using computer vision techniques. This project leverages OpenCV and pre-trained deep learning models to detect and follow objects in video streams or webcam feeds.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Real-time object detection using deep learning models (YOLO, SSD, etc.)
- ✅ Object tracking using algorithms like CSRT, KCF, or SORT
- ✅ Supports video input from webcam or file
- ✅ Bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores
- ✅ Configurable tracking for specific object classes
- ✅ Frame-by-frame visualization and video output saving

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pretrained object detection models (e.g., YOLOv5, MobileNet SSD)
- (Optional) PyTorch / TensorFlow (if using DL-based models)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-tracking.git
cd object-tracking

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
⚙️ Running the Application
bash
Copy
Edit
# Run on webcam
python main.py --source 0

# Run on video file
python main.py --source videos/sample.mp4
Sample Arguments
--source: Input source (default is webcam: 0)

--model: Path to object detection model (optional)

--tracker: Tracking algorithm (e.g., CSRT, KCF, MIL)

--output: Save output video

🖼️ Output Example
Bounding boxes with object names and confidence levels drawn in real-time.


🛠️ Supported Tracking Algorithms
You can change the tracker in code or via command line:

CSRT (high accuracy)

KCF (fast but less accurate)

MIL

MOSSE

MedianFlow

📌 TODO / Improvements
 Add support for multiple object classes

 Add UI controls (pause, resume, stop)

 Integrate more accurate detectors like YOLOv8 or EfficientDet

 Evaluate performance across models

🧪 Example Use Cases
Autonomous surveillance

Sports player tracking

Object tracking in robotics

Vehicle tracking in traffic videos
